Our goal is to create a funcional website featureing:
	Map of SOUTH BEND James Whitcomb Riley High school  with room numbers
	List of sessions with room numbers associated
	About BTSU page - blurb about what they are trying to do
	Credit to creators page - about students
	Attendees list with names and emails for collaboration
	(opt) profile with social media links
	Speakers list with people running the sessions - image of self, title, name, email, bio/about me
	Vendors visible on the app, sponsors (large and small)
	Twitter feed embedded in the app showing #BTSU23
	Activity feed for global announcements
	Registration on PLHub - could it be tied to the app, with a calendar
